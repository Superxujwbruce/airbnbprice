# airbnbprice

• Used machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistics regression, random forest and XGBoost to predict price per night of Airbnb based on a large dataset with R.

• Implemented data cleaning and data transformation, such as dealing with NAs in some levels and conducting logarithmic transformation of price to improve the result.

• Utilized data visualization to explore the relationship between price and other variables with ggplot2, and selected variables that have strong relationships with price to advance the model performance.
